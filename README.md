## Controls:  
* **Mouse**  
* **Pause time** with spacebar or the pause button **(for planning and reading)**  
---
### Sacrificing:  
* Choose desired effect, choose people, and click sacrifice  
* **Some offers have multiple requirements**  
---
### People:
* **Can change profession in the People tab**  
* Farmers produce food  
* Civilians give birth to new people  
* Warriors increase army strength  
---
### Mechanics:  
* If food production is less than population, some people will lose health due to starvation.  
* If your army strength is less than the invaders, some of your people will take damage.  
* People grow more efficient as they level up. Xp is earned passively. Level is reset when profession is changed. Max level can be increased in the Permanent Demands tab.  
* Max population is 10.

### Tips:  
* Try to **increase your population size early**.  
* Once you have 5+ people, it's ok to sacrifice, you can repopulate.  
* **It's ok to take some damage**. Plague/Invaders/Starvation will usually only damage some of your people.  
* **Use the pause button** to plan ahead and to read things.
